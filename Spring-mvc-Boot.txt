#What is Spring?
###################
“Spring is an open-source Java framework that helps developers build scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.
The core idea of Spring is Dependency Injection, which makes your code loosely coupled.
Spring is lightweight, modular, and provides many ready-made modules like Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring Boot, which speed up development.”

what is Spring Principal?
#############################
Spring is based on principles like Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and loose coupling.
These principles help in building scalable, maintainable, and testable applications.


What is Dependency Injection (DI) ?
#######################################################
-> Dependency Injection is a design pattern used by Spring Boot to automatically create and manage objects (dependencies) your classes need — without you manually creating them.
-> Dependency Injection is a technique where objects (dependencies) are injected into a class by the framework (Spring) at runtime rather than the   object creating them itself.


In simple words:
Class will not create its own objects — Spring will give those objects.  
Analogy:x 
------------
Imagine you're building a house. You don’t make the bricks yourself — you ask someone to provide them.
Similarly, Spring Boot provides the objects your app needs.



Why Use DI?
###############
“We use DI to make the application loosely coupled, easier to test, easy to maintain, and to let Spring manage object creation instead of manual new() operations.”



What is Loose Coupling?
############################3
Loose coupling means classes are independent of each other.
ex -
class StudentService {
    private StudentRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public StudentService(StudentRepository repo) { // dependency injected
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
Now StudentService doesn’t care how repo is created.


What is Tight Coupling?
#########################
Tight coupling means one class is highly dependent on another class’s implementation.
The classes are strongly connected — if one changes, the other must change too.
exex-
class StudentService {
    StudentRepository repo = new StudentRepository(); // tightly coupled   ,If Repository changes, you must modify StudentService.
}


What is Spring IOC(INVERSION OF CONTROL)?
##############################################3
-> Spring IOC Container is the core of the Spring Framework.
-> It manages the lifecycle and Creation of application objects (called beans).
-> It creates, configures, and wires objects automatically based on configuration
-> Helps implement Dependency Injection (DI) easily.
-> Promotes loose coupling because your classes don’t instantiate their dependencies directly.


Spring Bean Life Cycle
########################
Bean is Created---->Dependencies Injected (@Autowired)----->Execution(Bean is use by the application)------>Destruction of the bean
“A Spring bean goes through four phases:
Spring creates the bean, injects dependencies using @Autowired, the bean is then used by the application, and finally Spring destroys it when the container shuts down. The entire lifecycle is automatically managed by the Spring IoC container.”



What is Bean Scope?'
#######################
Bean Scope refers to the lifecycle and visibility of a bean — meaning how often a bean object is created and how long it will remain alive within the Spring container.
Common Bean Scopes in Spring:

1.Singleton(Default) - Only one instance per Spring container it is shared across all application

2.Prototype - Creates a new bean instance every time it is requested

3.Request (Web Only) -One bean instance per HTTP request

4.Session (Web Only) -One bean instance per HTTP session

5.Application (Web Only)- One bean instance per ServletContext


what is Bean factory
#####################
BeanFactory is the basic Spring container responsible for creating and managing beans using lazy initialization. ApplicationContext is the advanced container.


what is ApplicationContext?
###########################
ApplicationContext is the fully-featured Spring container that manages beans with advanced capabilities like AOP, event handling, and eager loading. It is preferred over BeanFactory in modern Spring applications


Types of Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring
################################################

1️⃣ Constructor Injection (Recommended) -Dependencies are injected through the constructor.

2️⃣ Setter Injection - Dependencies are injected using setter methods.

3️⃣ Field Injection -Spring injects dependencies directly into fields using @Autowired.


Why We Use Constructor-Based Dependency Injection?
###################################################
Constructor-based DI is considered the best practice in Spring because it provides stronger safety, clarity, and testability.
“Constructor-based DI is preferred because it makes dependencies mandatory, promotes immutability, prevents null values, and makes unit testing easy.
Promotes Immutability means-  All dependencies are final and cannot be changed after object creation.
mandatory dependencies means -If Repo is missing, the class cannot be created, preventing runtime errors.


Why Don’t We Use @Autowired (Field Injection) in Modern Spring?
####################################################################33
We avoid @Autowired on fields because it makes the class hard to test, hides dependencies, prevents immutability, and tightly couples code to Spring.


What is JPA?
#####################3
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification provided by Java for ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
It defines how Java objects should be mapped to database tables and how to perform CRUD operations in an object-oriented way.


What is Spring Data JPA?
##########################
“Spring Data JPA makes database operations very easy. Instead of writing repository classes, SQL, or EntityManager code, we simply create a repository interface extending JpaRepository, and Spring automatically provides all CRUD opearation , pagination, and derived queries. It reduces boilerplate and speeds up development.”
ex-
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer> {
}

By default, Spring Data JPA uses Hibernate as the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool in Spring Boot applications (unless you configure another JPA provider manually).



What is Spring Profile?
###########################
Spring Profile is a feature in Spring that allows you to separate and manage different configurations for different environments like:dev,test,stage,prod

How to Activate a Profile?
ans -Using properties file              add  -> spring.profiles.active=dev


What is Spring MVC?
##########################
-> Spring MVC stands for Spring Model-View-Controller.
—> It's a web framework in the Spring used to build web applications using the MVC design pattern.


How Spring MVC Work?
######################
“In Spring MVC, every request first goes to the DispatcherServlet. It finds the appropriate controller using HandlerMapping, executes the controller logic, and returns a Model and view name. The ViewResolver converts the view name to the actual page, the view is rendered with model data, and the final response is sent back to the client.”


1. DispatcherServlet
#########################
“DispatcherServlet is the front controller of Spring MVC. Every incoming HTTP request first goes to DispatcherServlet, and it routes the request to the appropriate controller.”


2. Controller
################
“A Controller is a class that handles HTTP requests. It has methods mapped using @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.” 
It Acts as mediator layer in MVC Architecture 


3. @Controller vs @RestController
######################################3
@Controller → It returns views (HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf)

@RestController → It returns JSON/XML (REST APIs)


4. Model
###############
"Model is used to pass data from Controller to the View." Model in Spring is an interface, not a class

Example:
model.addAttribute("name", "Sanjeev");

5. ViewResolver
#####################
“ViewResolver maps the logical view name returned by the controller to the actual View page.”

Example:
Controller returns → "home"   
ViewResolver maps → /WEB-INF/views/home.jsp       //actual view page


6. View
#######
“The View is the UI layer that displays data, like JSP, Thymeleaf, HTML.”


7. @RequestMapping
################# 
“ It’s a Spring MVC annotation used to map HTTP requests to handler methods or classes in your controller.
ex -@RequestMapping("/login")      Now it is replaced by Getmapping .Postmapping,Putmapping,Deletemapping  


8. @ModelAttribute
##################
“@ModelAttribute binds form data (UI input) to a model object automatically.

ex -public String save(@ModelAttribute User user)


9. @RequestParam
################
“ It Used to fetch data from URL query parameters and passes them into your controller method."
ex- @GetMapping("/search")
public String search(@RequestParam String keyword)


10. @PathVariable
#################
“ It Used to fetch values from the URL path.”

ex-@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUser(@PathVariable int id)


11. HandlerMapping
##################
“HandlerMapping finds the correct controller method for incoming requests.”

It works inside DispatcherServlet.

🔥 12. HandlerAdapter
######################
“HandlerAdapter helps DispatcherServlet to execute the matched controller method.”


What is ModelMap in Spring MVC?
###############################
a. ModelMap is a special object provided by Spring MVC to pass data from your controller to the view layer (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
b. It behaves like a Map (key-value pairs)

what is JSTL tags?
##################
-> Using JSTL we can write java code in the form of tags inside JSP pages
-> This makes non java developer to embed java code inside JSP


What is Spring Initializr?
##############################
Spring Initializr is an online tool provided by Spring (https://start.spring.io/
) that helps developers quickly generate a Spring Boot project with all required dependencies.
