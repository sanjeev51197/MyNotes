#What is Spring?
###################
“Spring is an open-source Java framework that helps developers build scalable, secure, and maintainable applications.
The core idea of Spring is Dependency Injection, which makes your code loosely coupled.
Spring is lightweight, modular, and provides many ready-made modules like Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring Boot, which speed up development.”

what is Spring Principal?
#############################
Spring is based on principles like Inversion of Control (IoC), Dependency Injection (DI), Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), and loose coupling.
These principles help in building scalable, maintainable, and testable applications.


What is Dependency Injection (DI) ?
#######################################################
-> Dependency Injection is a design pattern used by Spring Boot to automatically create and manage objects (dependencies) your classes need — without you manually creating them.
-> Dependency Injection is a technique where objects (dependencies) are injected into a class by the framework (Spring) at runtime rather than the   object creating them itself.


In simple words:
Class will not create its own objects — Spring will give those objects.  
Analogy:x 
------------
Imagine you're building a house. You don’t make the bricks yourself — you ask someone to provide them.
Similarly, Spring Boot provides the objects your app needs.



Why Use DI?
###############
“We use DI to make the application loosely coupled, easier to test, easy to maintain, and to let Spring manage object creation instead of manual new() operations.”



What is Loose Coupling?
############################3
Loose coupling means classes are independent of each other.
ex -
class StudentService {
    private StudentRepository repo;

    @Autowired
    public StudentService(StudentRepository repo) { // dependency injected
        this.repo = repo;
    }
}
Now StudentService doesn’t care how repo is created.


What is Tight Coupling?
#########################
Tight coupling means one class is highly dependent on another class’s implementation.
The classes are strongly connected — if one changes, the other must change too.
exex-
class StudentService {
    StudentRepository repo = new StudentRepository(); // tightly coupled   ,If Repository changes, you must modify StudentService.
}


What is Spring IOC(INVERSION OF CONTROL)?
##############################################3
-> Spring IOC Container is the core of the Spring Framework.
-> It manages the lifecycle and Creation of application objects (called beans).
-> It creates, configures, and wires objects automatically based on configuration
-> Helps implement Dependency Injection (DI) easily.
-> Promotes loose coupling because your classes don’t instantiate their dependencies directly.


Spring Bean Life Cycle
########################
Bean is Created---->Dependencies Injected (@Autowired)----->Execution(Bean is use by the application)------>Destruction of the bean
“A Spring bean goes through four phases:
Spring creates the bean, injects dependencies using @Autowired, the bean is then used by the application, and finally Spring destroys it when the container shuts down. The entire lifecycle is automatically managed by the Spring IoC container.”



What is Bean Scope?'
#######################
Bean Scope refers to the lifecycle and visibility of a bean — meaning how often a bean object is created and how long it will remain alive within the Spring container.
Common Bean Scopes in Spring:

1.Singleton(Default) - Only one instance per Spring container it is shared across all application

2.Prototype - Creates a new bean instance every time it is requested

3.Request (Web Only) -One bean instance per HTTP request

4.Session (Web Only) -One bean instance per HTTP session

5.Application (Web Only)- One bean instance per ServletContext


what is Bean factory
#####################
BeanFactory is the basic Spring container responsible for creating and managing beans using lazy initialization. ApplicationContext is the advanced container.


what is ApplicationContext?
###########################
ApplicationContext is the fully-featured Spring container that manages beans with advanced capabilities like AOP, event handling, and eager loading. It is preferred over BeanFactory in modern Spring applications


Types of Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring
################################################

1️⃣ Constructor Injection (Recommended) -Dependencies are injected through the constructor.

2️⃣ Setter Injection - Dependencies are injected using setter methods.

3️⃣ Field Injection -Spring injects dependencies directly into fields using @Autowired.


Why We Use Constructor-Based Dependency Injection?
###################################################
Constructor-based DI is considered the best practice in Spring because it provides stronger safety, clarity, and testability.
“Constructor-based DI is preferred because it makes dependencies mandatory, promotes immutability, prevents null values, and makes unit testing easy.
Promotes Immutability means-  All dependencies are final and cannot be changed after object creation.
mandatory dependencies means -If Repo is missing, the class cannot be created, preventing runtime errors.


Why Don’t We Use @Autowired (Field Injection) in Modern Spring?
####################################################################33
We avoid @Autowired on fields because it makes the class hard to test, hides dependencies, prevents immutability, and tightly couples code to Spring.


What is JPA?
#####################3
JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification provided by Java for ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
It defines how Java objects should be mapped to database tables and how to perform CRUD operations in an object-oriented way.


What is Spring Data JPA?
##########################
“Spring Data JPA makes database operations very easy. Instead of writing repository classes, SQL, or EntityManager code, we simply create a repository interface extending JpaRepository, and Spring automatically provides all CRUD opearation , pagination, and derived queries. It reduces boilerplate and speeds up development.”
ex-
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Integer> {
}

By default, Spring Data JPA uses Hibernate as the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool in Spring Boot applications (unless you configure another JPA provider manually).



What is Spring Profile?
###########################
Spring Profile is a feature in Spring that allows you to separate and manage different configurations for different environments like:dev,test,stage,prod

How to Activate a Profile?
ans -Using properties file              add  -> spring.profiles.active=dev


What is Spring MVC?
##########################
-> Spring MVC stands for Spring Model-View-Controller.
—> It's a web framework in the Spring used to build web applications using the MVC design pattern.


How Spring MVC Work?
######################
“In Spring MVC, every request first goes to the DispatcherServlet. It finds the appropriate controller using HandlerMapping, executes the controller logic, and returns a Model and view name. The ViewResolver converts the view name to the actual page, the view is rendered with model data, and the final response is sent back to the client.”


1. DispatcherServlet
#########################
“DispatcherServlet is the front controller of Spring MVC. Every incoming HTTP request first goes to DispatcherServlet, and it routes the request to the appropriate controller.”


2. Controller
################
“A Controller is a class that handles HTTP requests. It has methods mapped using @GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc.” 
It Acts as mediator layer in MVC Architecture 


3. @Controller vs @RestController
######################################3
@Controller → It returns views (HTML, JSP, Thymeleaf)

@RestController → It returns JSON/XML (REST APIs)


4. Model
###############
"Model is used to pass data from Controller to the View." Model in Spring is an interface, not a class

Example:
model.addAttribute("name", "Sanjeev");

5. ViewResolver
#####################
“ViewResolver maps the logical view name returned by the controller to the actual View page.”

Example:
Controller returns → "home"   
ViewResolver maps → /WEB-INF/views/home.jsp       //actual view page


6. View
#######
“The View is the UI layer that displays data, like JSP, Thymeleaf, HTML.”


7. @RequestMapping
################# 
“ It’s a Spring MVC annotation used to map HTTP requests to handler methods or classes in your controller.
ex -@RequestMapping("/login")      Now it is replaced by Getmapping .Postmapping,Putmapping,Deletemapping  


8. @ModelAttribute
##################
“@ModelAttribute binds form data (UI input) to a model object automatically.

ex -public String save(@ModelAttribute User user)


9. @RequestParam
################
“ It Used to fetch data from URL query parameters and passes them into your controller method."
ex- @GetMapping("/search")
public String search(@RequestParam String keyword)


10. @PathVariable
#################
“ It Used to fetch values from the URL path.”

ex-@GetMapping("/user/{id}")
public String getUser(@PathVariable int id)


11. HandlerMapping
##################
“HandlerMapping finds the correct controller method for incoming requests.”

It works inside DispatcherServlet.

🔥 12. HandlerAdapter
######################
“HandlerAdapter helps DispatcherServlet to execute the matched controller method.”


What is ModelMap in Spring MVC?
###############################
a. ModelMap is a special object provided by Spring MVC to pass data from your controller to the view layer (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
b. It behaves like a Map (key-value pairs)

what is JSTL tags?
##################
-> Using JSTL we can write java code in the form of tags inside JSP pages
-> This makes non java developer to embed java code inside JSP


What is Spring Initializr?
##############################
Spring Initializr is an online tool provided by Spring (https://start.spring.io/
) that helps developers quickly generate a Spring Boot project with all required dependencies.



What is Spring boot
################################

Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create stand-alone applications quickly and easily with minimal configuration.

Spring Boot Stand-Alone Application:
-------------------------------------------
-> You just run a main() method like any regular Java program.
-> It includes an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) in the application itself.
-> No need to install or configure any external server separately.

Note: Since Spring boot is stand alone application, we package the application as jar file


Spring Boot Workflow (Short Answer)
#####################################
You run the Spring Boot app → main() executes
SpringApplication.run() starts the Spring context
Auto-configuration configures beans
Embedded Tomcat starts
Your controllers/services/repos load
Application becomes ready to receive requests



 What is @Service?
######################
a. @Service is a Spring stereotype annotation.
b. It marks a class as a Service component in the Service Layer of your application.
c. Spring will detect it during component scanning and create an instance (bean) of that class in the Spring IOC container
d. It makes your class eligible for dependency injection.

 What is @Component?
####################
a. @Component is a generic Spring annotation to mark a class as a Spring-managed bean.
b. When you annotate a class with @Component, Spring will detect it during component scanning and create an instance (bean) of that class in the Spring IOC container.
c. It makes your class eligible for dependency injection.


what is @SpringBootApplication
##############################
It is the Main annotation used to mark the entry point of a Spring Boot application.
It is a combination of: @Configuration ,@EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan
Purpose:
It Starts auto-configuration, component scanning, and bootstraps the app.


What is @Configuration
################
It Marks a class that contains bean definitions. It Equivalent to XML-based configuration.


what is Bean in SpringBoot?
############################
In Spring Boot, a Bean is an object that is created, managed, and controlled by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.
Why Beans are needed -

Spring manages objects instead of us creating them using new keyword
Enables Dependency Injection
Promotes loose coupling
Improves testability and maintainability

What is @Bean
#############
It Used inside @Configuration classes to create custom beans manually.


What is @Repository
#####################
It Marks a class as DAO (Data Access Layer).


What is a Web Service?
########################
A Web Service is a software component that allows two applications to communicate with each other over a network (like the Internet) using standard protocols.  It enables machine-to-machine communication.
Example:
A mobile app calling a server to get user details
A billing system communicating with an order system



1. SOAP Web Services (Simple Object Access Protocol)
###################################################
SOAP is a protocol that uses XML for data exchange and follows strict standards for communication. Often used in banking, telecom, enterprise systems.


2. RESTful Web Services (Representational State Transfer)
##########################################################
REST is an architectural style for building lightweight web services that use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations.
Features-
Uses JSON (mostly), also XML
Lightweight and fast
Best suited for web, mobile apps, and microservices



Simple Definition
##################
Web Service is a mechanism that enables communication between applications over a network. There are two types: SOAP (protocol-based) and REST (architecture-based). RESTful web services are lightweight, fast, stateless services that use HTTP methods and usually return JSON data.



What is @RestController in Spring Boot?
########################################
@RestController is a Spring annotation that is used to create RESTful web services that return data in JSON format

It is a combination of:  @Controller  and  @ResponseBody

This means:
✔ It handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
✔ It returns data (JSON/XML) directly to the client
✔ No need to return a view (HTML/JSP)
🧠 Why do we use @RestController?

It is used To build REST APIs quickly
It Automatically converts Java objects → into  JSON using Jackson
We don't need to write @ResponseBody on every method
It Ideal for microservices.
                           
Definitions
###############
a. ResponseEntity helps us to send both the required HTTP status code and response data (usually in JSON format).

b. @RequestBody is an annotation in Spring used to bind the HTTP request body (usually in JSON format) to a Java object.

c. @RestController It is used to create RESTful web services that return data in JSON format

d. @PostMapping is a Spring MVC annotation used to handle HTTP POST requests.
   It is typically used when you want to submit or create new data, such as inserting a record into the database.




What is Status Code
###################
Status codes in Spring Boot are HTTP response codes (like 200, 400, 404, 500) sent by the server to indicate success, client error, or server error in a request.

Status Code: 201 It  indicates that a resource has been successfully created as a result of a POST request.

Status Code: 200 – OK --> means The request was successful, and the server has returned the expected response.

Status Code: 404 – Not Found --> means The resource the client is trying to access does not exist on the server.

Status Code : 500 – Internal Server Error  means --> The server encountered an unexpected error while processing the request.
Causes:
NullPointerException
Database connection error

Status Code : 403 – Forbidden  --> means The server understood the request, the resource exists, but the client is not allowed to access it. because User does NOT have required permissions 
This is an authorization error, not an authentication error. 


What is Spring Boot @Value Annotation?
#########################################
“@Value is a Spring annotation used to inject values into fields — such as properties from application.properties, environment variables, system properties, or even literal values.

ex- Inject from application.properties             

@Value("${app.name}")                               
private String appName;  

Inject a hard-coded value
@Value("Hello World")
private String msg;


What is @Qualifier in Spring?
###############################
@Qualifier is used in Spring to resolve ambiguity when more than one bean of the same type exists. It tells Spring which specific bean to inject when multiple choices are available.


What is Postman?
################
Postman is a popular API testing tool used to send requests and receive responses from REST APIs.
It helps developers test APIs without writing any front-end code. 
To access swagger use swagger dependencies and hit http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html


What is Swagger?
################
Swagger is a tool used to document, test, and interact with REST APIs.
In Spring Boot, Swagger helps developers and testers view all APIs in a clean UI and test them without Postman. 


What is Idempotent?
####################
Idempotent means:  An operation that gives the same result, no matter how many times you repeat it.

In REST APIs, an HTTP method is idempotent if calling it once or multiple times produces the same effect on the server.
GET method ,PUT METHOD , DELETE are idempotent method but POST is non-idempotent because calling multiple times it produces multiple record.


What is Spring Boot Actuator?
#############################
Spring Boot Actuator is a built-in module in Spring Boot that provides production-ready monitoring and management features for your application.
It helps DevOps, developers, and monitoring tools understand the app’s status.
It provides REST endpoints to monitor, manage, and get diagnostic information about your Spring Boot application in real time.



What is application.properties in Spring Boot?
#############################################
application.properties (or application.yml) is the main configuration file in a Spring Boot application.

It is used to configure application-level settings such as: Server port ,Database connection ,Logging ,Profiles ,Security
Spring Boot automatically reads this file at startup.



XML vs JSON
###############
XML is a tag-based structured format suitable for complex data and used in SOAP-based web services.
JSON is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-read format widely used in REST APIs for data exchange.



How to Send Email in Spring Boot?
#################################
To send an email in Spring Boot, we use the spring-boot-starter-mail dependency. It provides JavaMailSender, which allows us to send simple and MIME emails using SMTP configuration.

Email Configuration in application.properties
For example (Gmail SMTP):

spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=yourgmail@gmail.com
spring.mail.password=your-app-password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true

Note: Use App Password, not your Gmail login password

How do we use Global Exception Handling in Spring Boot?
########################################################
In Spring Boot, Global Exception Handling allows you to handle all exceptions in one centralized place instead of writing try–catch in every controller.
We use @ControllerAdvice + @ExceptionHandler to achieve this.


When do we use @Valid in Spring Boot?
######################################
We use @Valid when we want to perform validation on incoming data (usually request body or form input) before processing it.
Spring Boot will automatically check all validation rules (like @NotNull, @Email, @Size, etc.) inside your DTO.

What happens when validation fails?   --->   Spring returns a 400 Bad Request with validation error messages.

Where can @Valid be applied?
#############################
| Where?           | Example                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Request Body     | `@Valid @RequestBody UserDTO`        |
| Path Variable    | `@Valid @PathVariable`               |
| Query Parameter  | `@Valid @RequestParam`               |
| Method arguments | `public void save(@Valid User user)` |


What does @SpringBootApplication do?
####################################
@SpringBootApplication is a combination of three important Spring annotations:
✅ @Configuration - It Marks the class as a configuration class where Spring can define beans.

✅ @EnableAutoConfiguration -

Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration, which automatically configures beans based on dependencies in the classpath.
(Example: If spring-boot-starter-web is present → Spring auto-configures DispatcherServlet, Tomcat, JSON converters, etc.)

✅ @ComponentScan -  Enables component scanning so Spring can detect:

@Controller
@Service
@Repository

Why do we use it?
#################
✔ To start Spring Boot application
✔ To enable auto configuration
✔ To avoid writing XML configuration
✔ To auto-detect beans and components
✔ To reduce boilerplate code


how to exclude in Springboot?
##############################
"In Spring Boot, we can exclude auto-configurations using @SpringBootApplication(exclude), exclude dependencies using Maven exclusions, and prevent beans from loading using @ComponentScan exclude filters. This is useful when we want to avoid unwanted auto configuration, resolve dependency conflicts,


//Executes for every request passing through the gateway
//Controls filter execution order
@Component
public class JwtAuthenticationFilter implements GlobalFilter, Ordered {
     //Used to verify JWT signature
    private static final String SECRET_KEY = "my-super-secret-key";

    // Public endpoints
    //These APIs do not require JWT
    //Login & registration must be public
    private static final List<String> openEndpoints = List.of(
            "/api/v1/auth/login",
            "/api/v1/auth/register-admin",
            "/api/v1/auth/register-user"
    );

    // Protected endpoint, only ROLE_ADMIN can access
    private static final Map<String, List<String>> protectedEndpoints =
            Map.of(
                    "/api/v1/data", List.of("ROLE_ADMIN") // Microservice1 protected endpoint
            );
     
    
    //This is the heart of the filter
    @Override
    public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {
        
    	
    	//Used to check whether endpoint is:Public or Protected
        String path = exchange.getRequest().getURI().getPath();

        // 1️⃣ Allow public endpoints ✔
        //If request is for login or registration
        // Skip JWT validation
        // Forward request immediately
        if (openEndpoints.stream().anyMatch(path::startsWith)) {
            return chain.filter(exchange);
        }

        // 2️⃣ Token Required  // Check Authorization Header JWT must be sent in:authorization 
        if (!exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().containsKey(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION)) {
            return onError(exchange, "Missing Authorization header", HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
        }

        String authHeader = exchange.getRequest().getHeaders().getFirst(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION);
            
        //Validate Bearer Format ,Prevents invalid headers
        if (authHeader == null || !authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
            return onError(exchange, "Invalid Authorization format", HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
        }
         //Extract Token from header and removes Bearer prefix
        String token = authHeader.substring(7);

        // 3️⃣ Validate jwt token
        String role;
        try {
            role = JWT.require(Algorithm.HMAC256(SECRET_KEY))
                    .build()
                    .verify(token)
                    .getClaim("role")
                    .asString();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            return onError(exchange, "Invalid/Expired Token", HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED);
        }

        // 4️⃣ Role-based access check
        for (String endpoint : protectedEndpoints.keySet()) {
            if (path.startsWith(endpoint)) {

                List<String> allowedRoles = protectedEndpoints.get(endpoint);

                if (!allowedRoles.contains(role)) {
                    return onError(exchange, "Access Denied", HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN);
                }
            }
        }

1.what is Singleton class?
##############################

Ans: A Singleton class is a class for which only one instance is created throughout the application.
It provides a global point of access to that instance.
Singleton is commonly used for objects like configuration, logging, database connections, or cache where multiple instances are not required.”

“In Spring Boot, singleton scope is the default scope for beans.
For example, service and repository beans are singletons, meaning only one instance is created per application context.”

2.What is the Difference between @Autowired & @Beans
######################################################

“@Autowired is used to inject a bean into another class, 
 whereas @Bean is used to create and define a bean in the Spring container or inside configuration class.”


Is there any other way to resolve bean conflication apart from using @configuration ,@Qualifier?
##################################################################################################
“Yes, apart from @Qualifier, we can resolve bean conflicts using @Primary, bean naming, profiles, conditional annotations, and constructor injection with explicit names.”

@primary - It Marks one bean as the default choice.


how can you identify performance problem and how to solve it?
#################################################################

I identify performance problems by monitoring application metrics like response time, CPU, memory, and thread usage using tools such as logs, APM tools, and profilers.
I analyze slow APIs, database queries, and GC behavior to find bottlenecks.
To solve them, I optimize queries, add caching, improve code efficiency, and tune JVM or application configurations.

what is springboot dependency ? why we use dependency in SB?
############################################################
A Spring Boot dependency is a library added to the project (via Maven or Gradle) that provides specific functionality like web, data access, or security.
We use dependencies in Spring Boot to avoid writing boilerplate code and to quickly enable features such as REST APIs, database connectivity, or security.
Spring Boot starters manage compatible versions internally, making application setup faster and simpler.


what are the starter dependency in spring boot ? what are the use of starter dependency
#################################################################################

Spring Boot starter dependencies are pre-configured dependency bundles that include all required libraries to build a specific feature.
We use starters to avoid manual dependency management and version conflicts, and to enable features quickly with minimal configuration.

Common Spring Boot Starter Dependencies & Uses

spring-boot-starter-web – Build REST APIs and web applications (Spring MVC, Tomcat, Jackson)
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa – Database access using JPA & Hibernate
spring-boot-starter-security – Authentication and authorization
spring-boot-starter-test – Testing support (JUnit, Mockito)
spring-boot-starter-actuator – Monitoring and health checks
spring-boot-starter-validation – Bean validation (JSR-380)

Difference between Spring and SpringBoot?
#########################################
Spring is a powerful framework but requires manual configuration and setup.
Spring Boot simplifies Spring by providing auto-configuration and starter dependencies.
In Spring, we need an external server, while Spring Boot comes with an embedded server like Tomcat.
Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code and speeds up application development.
It also provides production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and monitoring.

what is Open Close Principal?
#################################
The Open–Closed Principle (OCP) states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means we should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
OCP helps in reducing bugs and makes the system easier to maintain and scale.

Simple example:
We achieve OCP using interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism—for example, adding a new payment method without modifying existing payment logic.


what is difference between Rest and Restful?
################################################
Here’s a clear, interview-ready explanation of the difference between REST and RESTful 👇

✅ Short Interview Answer (Best)

REST is an architectural style that defines rules for designing web services, while RESTful refers to web services that follow those REST principles.
🔹 Detailed Explanation
🔸 REST

It Stands for Representational State Transfer
It is a set of constraints/principles, not a technology
It Defines how APIs should be designed (stateless, client-server, cacheable, etc.)

🔸 RESTful

 RESTful service is an implementation of REST
It Uses proper HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
It Returns resource representations (usually JSON/XML)


What is the Difference between HTTP and HTTPS
################################################
HTTP transfers data in plain text and is not secure.
HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS for secure communication.
HTTPS protects data from attackers and ensures authenticity.
Therefore, HTTPS is used for secure and sensitive applications.



Difference between @Component and @service?
############################################

“Both @Component and @Service are Spring stereotypes used to create beans, but @Service is specifically meant for the service layer to represent business logic, while @Component is a generic stereotype  that  Can be used for any Spring-managed component.”
.

explain Design pattern Solid Principal and Acid properting?
###########################################################
Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common design problems.Examples: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy
SOLID principles help in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code.
They reduce tight coupling and improve flexibility.
ACID properties ensure reliable and consistent database transactions.
Together, they form the foundation of robust enterprise applications.

How to create Singleton class
################################
A Singleton class ensures only one instance of a class is created.
It uses a private constructor and a static method to provide the instance.
The best implementation is using Enum or Double-Checked Locking.


what is Volatile keyword?
##########################
It is commonly used in Singleton and multi-threaded applications.
We use volatile to ensure visibility of changes to a variable across multiple threads.
It guarantees that when one thread updates a variable, other threads see the latest value immediately.

Spring Boot lifecycle?
###########################
Spring Boot starts from the main() method using SpringApplication.run().
It loads environment configurations and performs auto-configuration.
Beans are created and dependencies are injected by the Spring container.
The embedded server starts and the application begins handling requests.
On shutdown, Spring executes destroy callbacks and releases resources.
