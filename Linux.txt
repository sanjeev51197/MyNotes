Text Editors in Linux
#########################

-> **vi (Visual Editor)** is the default text editor in Linux systems.  

-> Using the `vi` command, we can create new files and edit existing ones.  

-> The `vi` editor operates in **three modes**:  

    1) **Command Mode** – Opens a file (default mode).  
       Example: vi <filename>  

    2) **Insert Mode** – Enables text editing.  
       - Press **'i'** on the keyboard to enter insert mode.  

    3) **Escape Mode** – Exits insert mode.  
       - Press **'Esc'** on the keyboard to return to command mode.  

    ## **Save changes and exit** → `:wq`  
    ## **Exit without saving changes** → `:q!`  

**Note:** If the specified file exists, `vi` will open it. If not, `vi` will create a new file and open it.

#############################

#################  
User Management  
#################  

-> **Linux is a multi-user operating system.**  

-> Multiple users can access a single Linux machine and perform multitasking simultaneously.  

**Note:** In Amazon Linux virtual machines (VMs), the default user is **"ec2-user"**, which has **sudo** privileges.  

-> A single Linux machine can have multiple user accounts.  

-> When a user account is created, a home directory is automatically assigned.  

        admin   => /home/admin  
        mike    => /home/mike  
        stallin => /home/stallin 

# **Create a new user**  
  sudo useradd <username>  

# **Set or update a user's password**  
  sudo passwd <username>  

# **Display all created users**  
  cat /etc/passwd  

# **Switch to another user account**  
  su <username>                        

# **Navigate to the current user's home directory**  
  cd ~  

#To go back to ec2-user just click ->   exit    enter

# **Delete a user account**  
  sudo userdel <username>  

# **Delete a user along with their home directory**  
  sudo userdel --remove <username>  

# **Change a username**  
  sudo usermod -l <new-username> <old-username>  

# **Important system files related to users:**  
- `/etc/passwd` → Stores general user information.  
- `/etc/shadow` → Stores encrypted passwords and security-related data.  

##################################  
Managing User Groups in Linux  
##################################  

-> Groups allow administrators to assign permissions (read, write, execute) to multiple users at once instead of managing permissions for each user individually.
Example: A development team can be assigned to a "developers" group with access to project files.

-> Instead of modifying each user’s access manually, administrators can add or remove users from a group to grant or revoke access.
_____________________
Example Scenario
____________________
Imagine a company with multiple departments:

developers → Can access code repositories.
designers → Can access design assets.
finance → Can access financial reports.

By assigning users to the right groups, the company can ensure that employees only access the files they need.



-> When a new user is created in Linux, a **default user group** with the same name is also created.  

# **Display all groups in Linux**  
  cat /etc/group  

# **Create a new group**  
  sudo groupadd <group-name>  

# **Add a user to a group**  
  sudo usermod -aG <group-name> <username>  

# **Remove a user from a group**  
  sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group-name>  

# **List all users in a specific group**  
  getent group <group-name>  

# **Check which groups a user belongs to**  
  id <username>  

# **Delete a group**  
  sudo groupdel <group-name>  

# **Rename a group**  
  sudo groupmod -n <new-group-name> <old-group-name>

Enabling Password-Based Authentication in Linux
________________________________________________

To enable password-based authentication in a Linux system, we need to modify two important configuration files:

1. sudoers
2. sshd_config

What is the sudoers file in Linux?
The sudoers file is a critical configuration file that controls which users can run commands as a superuser (root).

$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
Warning: Editing the sudoers file incorrectly can break the system. Always use the visudo command to edit it safely.

$ sudo visudo
Add the following line at the end of the file:

<username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
Press CTRL + X, then Y, and hit Enter.

How to Enable Password-Based Authentication for Users?
By default, password authentication is disabled in Linux virtual machines (VMs) for security reasons. To enable it:

Open the sshd_config file:

$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Modify the following line:
Find this line:

PasswordAuthentication no
Change it to:

PasswordAuthentication yes
Save and exit (ESC → :wq → Enter).

Restart the SSH service for changes to take effect:

$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
Now, you can connect to the Linux VM using a username and password:

$ ssh username@public-ip

####################################################################################################################
File Permissions in Linux

File permissions will give restricted access to the users
####################################################################################################################

Types of Permissions - 
Linux has three basic types of permissions:

r → Read (View file contents)
w → Write (Modify or delete file contents)
x → Execute (Run as a program or script)

Understanding File/Directory Permissions - 

Permissions are represented using 9 characters, as shown below:
rwxrwxrwx f1.txt

Each section of the permission string corresponds to different user categories:
1. First 3 characters → Owner/User permissions
2. Middle 3 characters → Group permissions
3. Last 3 characters → Others (everyone else) permissions

Examples:
r--r-xr--  f2.txt
User (Owner): Read (r--)
Group: Read + Execute (r-x)
Others: Read (r--)

r-xrw--w-  f3.txt
User (Owner): Read + Execute (r-x)
Group: Read + Write (rw-)
Others: Write (--w)

Changing File/Directory Permissions Using chmod
The chmod command allows you to modify file permissions:

+ → Add permission
- → Remove permission

Examples:

# Give execute permission to the user
chmod u+x f1.txt

# Give write permission to the group
chmod g+w f1.txt

# Remove execute permission from others
chmod o-x f1.txt

# Remove all permissions from others
chmod o-rwx f1.txt

# Grant all permissions to the group
chmod g+rwx f1.txt
File Permissions in Numeric Format
Permissions can also be represented using numbers (0–7), where:

Number	Permissions
0	No permissions
1	Execute only
2	Write only
3	Write + Execute
4	Read only
5	Read + Execute
6	Read + Write
7	Read + Write + Execute
Examples:

# Give execute permission to all (ugo+x)
chmod 111 f1.txt

# Give write permission to all (ugo+w)
chmod 222 f1.txt

# User: rwx, Group: rw, Others: rx
chmod 765 f1.txt

# User: r, Group: rx, Others: rw
chmod 456 f1.txt

# Give full permissions to everyone
chmod 777 f1.txt

# Remove all permissions from User & Group, but allow Others full access
chmod 007 f1.txt

Summary
Permissions (r, w, x) define access control for files and directories.
They apply to three user categories: Owner, Group, Others.
Use chmod to modify permissions either in symbolic (u+x, g-w, etc.) or numeric (755, 644, etc.) format.
Numeric permissions use a combination of values (0–7) to set access levels efficiently.

############################################################################################
chown Command in Linux
The chown command is used to change the ownership of files and directories in Linux. It allows modifying both the owner and the group associated with a file or directory.
#############################################################################################

1️⃣ Basic Syntax

sudo chown [new-owner] [file/directory]
or
sudo chown [new-owner]:[new-group] [file/directory]

2️⃣ Changing File/Directory Ownership
1. Change the Owner of a File
sudo chown user1 file.txt
✅ Effect: file.txt will now belong to user1.

2. Change Only the Group
sudo chown :group1 file.txt
✅ Effect: The group of file.txt is now group1, but the owner remains unchanged.

3. Change Both Owner and Group
sudo chown user1:group1 file.txt
✅ Effect: file.txt now belongs to user1 and group1.

####################################################################################################
Finding Files in Linux
In Linux, the find command is used to search for files and directories based on different criteria such as name, type, size, and modification time.
#####################################################################################################

1️⃣ Basic Syntax

find [directory] [options] [search criteria]
[directory] → The location where you want to search (e.g., /home, /var, etc.).
[options] → Filters such as file name, type, size, date, etc.
[search criteria] → The specific property you are searching for.

2️⃣ Common Use Cases
1. Find a File by Name

sudo find /home -name "f1.txt"
✅ Effect: Searches for f1.txt inside the /home directory.

2. Find Empty Files
sudo find /home -type f -empty
✅ Effect: Lists all empty files (-type f) inside /home.

3. Find Empty Directories
sudo find /home -type d -empty
✅ Effect: Lists all empty directories (-type d) inside /home.

3️⃣ Finding Files Based on Modification Time
The -mtime option searches for files based on modification time.

4. Find Files Modified 30 Days Ago
sudo find /home -mtime 30 -print
✅ Effect: Displays files inside /home that were last modified 30 days ago.

5. Find Files Modified 1 Day Ago
sudo find /home -mtime 1 -print
✅ Effect: Displays files inside /home that were modified 1 day ago.

6. Delete Files Older Than 30 Days
sudo find /home -mtime +30 -delete
✅ Effect: Deletes files inside /home that haven’t been modified in the last 30 days.

Linux Architecture Components
#####################################

The Linux operating system is built on a modular architecture consisting of four main components:

1) Applications / Commands

These are the user-space programs that run on Linux, such as web browsers and linux commands

2) Shell

The shell acts as an interface between users and the system.

It interprets commands and sends them to the kernel for execution.

Examples of Linux shells:

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) - Default shell in most Linux distributions.

Zsh (Z Shell) - Advanced shell with additional features.

Fish - User-friendly, interactive shell.

3) Kernel

The core component of Linux that manages system resources.

Responsibilities include:

Process Management - Allocating CPU time to running programs.

Memory Management - Handling RAM space.

Device Management - Communicating with hardware like hard drives and USB devices.

System Calls - Allowing applications to request services from the operating system.

4) Hardware Components

The physical components of a Linux system, including:

CPU - Executes instructions.

RAM - Stores temporary data for processes.

Storage (HDD/SSD) - Holds files and the operating system.

Network Interfaces - Enables communication between devices.

Peripherals - Includes keyboards, mice, printers, etc.

Each of these components works together to ensure a stable and functional Linux environment.
