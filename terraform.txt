Architecture of Terraform 
##########################

1.First creates a main.tf file     'tf' is the extension of terraform file

2.then we add the provider block using secret and access key  and resource you want to perform. 

3.we apply terraform init which adds all the plugin and it creates a .terraform.lock.hcl file which keeps all the plugin given by the provider for future purpose.

4.we then use terraform validate to validates the configurtion checks correct syntax . also we apply terraform fmt for syntax correctness and white spaces.

5.then we generate a terraform plan document by plan -t=tplan . 

6.then we use terraform apply     .that creates a Json based on json structure it creates the aws resources.
